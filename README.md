# Simple OpenAI real time API with tool calling

Most code came from <https://github.com/disler/poc-realtime-ai-assistant> where this repo re-organizes them into modules and a dynamic tool lib with tool templates for future extensions.

## Try it

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python workflow.py
```

For MacOS users, make sure to install Xcode and `brew install portaudio` so `PyAudio` can compile.
